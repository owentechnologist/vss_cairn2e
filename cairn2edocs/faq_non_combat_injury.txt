Occasionally a dangerous action, trap, surprise attack, or cataclysmic event will cause grave injury or even death. Typically the Warden declares the type of damage (e.g. STR/DEX/WIL) followed by the amount lost (either in terms of specific amounts, or a variable dice roll). It can be difficult to determine exactly what kind of damage to dole out, and how much.

If the injury affects their physical strength or health, subtract from STR. This does not trigger a critical damage save. STR is a reflection of a PC’s health, and should reflect that in subtle but interesting ways: perhaps requiring a save where none would have been necessary before.
If the injury impacts their ability to move, react quickly, or their fine motor skills, subtract from DEX. This frequently is paired with an in-fiction impact as well; broken fingers would impact a PC’s ability to pick locks, for example.
If the spirit, willpower, or determination of a PC has been impacted, subtract from WIL. Especially helpful to consider during magical or superficial injuries. A PC whose soul was burnt by arcane energy may need to make a WIL save to read Spellbooks, for example.
A few considerations:

An injury could take on multiple facets: Deprivation may accompany STR loss from poison, for instance. Provide a potential solution to overcoming the illness, as well.
Damage should happen as a consequence of failing a save. Do not make players save after-the-fact.
Fictional injuries are just as powerful as direct mechanical damage. DEX loss will have an impact on a character’s reflexes and speed, but a broken leg may prevent a character from being able to move at all!
