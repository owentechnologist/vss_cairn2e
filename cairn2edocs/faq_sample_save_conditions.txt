A PC or NPC should save only if one or more of the following conditions are met:

When the outcome of an action is uncertain.
When something is at risk (a life, a threatening danger, etc.).
When making a critical damage save during combat.
Saves can happen both in an out of combat. A save is almost never required when a PC or NPC is under attack, as attacks hit automatically. However, there are situations in which the fiction might dictate that an attack is automatically unsuccessful or impossible.
