In Cairn, character growth is preferable over advancement. This means that although a PC will change, they may not necessarily get better with time. Growth occurs through both mechanical means (such as Scars), as well as through events happening solely in the fiction.

The Warden should consider the following when awarding non-mechanical growth to PCs:

Growth should be tied to a specific experience occurring in the fiction.
It is more important for a PC to grow more interesting than more skilled or capable.
PCs experience growth not necessarily because they’ve gotten more skill and experience, but because they are changed in a significant way.
There should be opportunities for growth & change everywhere, especially when a PC puts themselves at risk.
Growth occurs while things are happening, not just after the PC has rested.
Training & Specialization should be tied to quests and character growth as much as possible.
A Few Examples of Training & Specialization:

Two days of study under a former royal archer has taught you how to fire arrows more effectively. Attacks with a longbow are enhanced.
After two weeks’ of daily practice with the Blade of Gwoed, you feel confident enough to use the deadly weapon in combat. Critical Damage: target loses a limb or is disemboweled (your choice).
Three days’ worth of study under the tutelage of a skilled warrior has taught you how to never be surprised. You no longer need to make a DEX save before combat (unless the Warden says otherwise).
Five nights of intense study with the Book of Curses has given you an edge in battle. If you insult an opponent before combat, all of their attacks against you and your friends are impaired.
Here is an example of character advancement through training and effort:

After training with the Mourning Monks of Es’ta, you can now speak with the dead. You are deprived afterwards.
