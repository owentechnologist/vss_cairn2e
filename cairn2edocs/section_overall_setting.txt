Summary

A setting has a Theme, Terrain, Details, and Factions.
See this page for an example setting, and generate (most) of the setting automatically with this.
Distance is measured in Watches, assuming that the party travels by foot.

Theme
To help create your setting’s theme, answer the following questions:

How does magic work?
What level of technology do the denizens have?
How does religion function? Do gods walk the lands, and do the people know it?
Who are the PCs in the setting? What is their position with respect to those in power?
What species & backgrounds exist, and are they playable by PCs?
What linguistic and cultural flavor exists in the setting?

Provinces
A Province is a single, traversable landscape roughly defined by divisible terrain (mountain ranges, rivers, oceans).
A Domain is one or more adjacent Provinces defined by the same ruler(s).
Each Province has a Heart: a settlement (of any size) that reflects the history, Factions, and peoples of the land.

Scale
Small Province: A Heart no more than four Watches from the furthest Detail, and up to 3 Factions.
Medium Province: A Heart no more than eight Watches from the furthest Detail, and up to 6 Factions.
Large Province: A Heart no more than sixteen Watches from the furthest Detail, and up to 9 Factions.

Creating a Province
On a flat sheet of paper, create a dot to signify the Heart of the Province.
Create three more dots in a triangle with the Heart in the rough center. Each of these dots represents an additional Detail on the map.
Connect two of the dots to the Heart, using solid lines to represent roads, dotted lines for trails, double solid lines for rivers, and double dotted lines for tunnels.
Connect the remaining dot to one of these paths, crossing it and continuing for a distance.
Repeat step 2, orienting the triangle of dots in a different way than before.
Connect two of the new dots to any path, but do not connect the final dot to anything! This is the Frontier.
Create a new dot wherever paths cross, and wherever a new path ends.
Number the dots, starting from the Heart and expanding outwards. The Heart is always 1, and the Frontier is always the terminal number.

TIPS
You can increase the Province Scale by doubling the size of the triangle in step 5, then adding dots halfway between two points on any line (roads, trails, rivers, etc.).
You can use other shapes (squares, rectangles, circles, etc.) to create dots instead. You can even mix & match!
You can repeat this process for any adjacent Provinces, connecting them by road, river, or range.

Adding Terrain
Roll on the Terrain table below for each numbered dot, starting with the Heart.
Terrain modifiers are based on the Terrain Difficulty rules. E = Easy, T = Tough, P = Perilous.
Draw or indicate the terrain for each dot on the map.

TERRAIN
d8	Terrain
1	Plains (E), grasslands (E), farmlands (E)
2	Oasis (E), lakes (T), sea (T)
3	River (T), bog (T), swamp (P)
4	Beaches (E), canyons (E), cliffs (T)
5	Valley (E), hills (T), mountains (P)
6	Plateau (E), hollows (T), wasteland (P)
7	Forest (T), thickets (T), jungle (P)
8	Tundra (T), desert (T), caverns (P)

SEASONS
Roll on the Seasonal Weather table for the Heart. Repeat for each season.
Roll on the Weird Weather Effects table once for the Frontier.

SEASONAL WEATHER
d6	Spring	Summer	Fall	Winter
1	Mild and sunny	Hot and sunny	Nice and breezy	Mild and clear
2	Nice and drizzly	Nice and cloudy	Mild and windy	Cool and windy
3	Cool and breezy	Mild and rainy	Cool and foggy	Cold and raining
4	Mild and cloudy	Cool and stormy	Cold and cloudy	Frigid and stormy
5	Cold and windy	Hot and humid	Cool and rainy	Freezing and snowing
6	Cold and rainy	Sweltering and humid	Chilly and stormy	Freezing and hailing

WEIRD WEATHER EFFECTS
d12	 
1	The clouds are shaped like faces. They appear to be laughing.
2	Roaming, coughing, dust clouds that smell of cinnamon.
3	Days are erratic. The Sun goes backwards for a time, then jumps forward as night rapidly sets.
4	Lakes and streams dry up in minutes, filling storm clouds that drench the landscape.
5	Rainbows lack most of their colors, and occasionally flicker. Raindrops fall in various colors. Do not taste them.
6	Distant chimes instead of thunder. A smoky, sweet wind of no apparent origin blows in from the West.
7	Fog there fills the belly (no need for rations). Tomorrow, vomiting.
8	The winds carry whispers of voices. Some say they tell hints of the future.
9	Shadows disappear at random. Animals are reluctant to enter.
10	Flashes of movement in the periphery that always amount to nothing. Travelers return without gaps in their memories.
11	The air is thicker than usual, and breathing is difficult. Drinking water seems to help.
12	Periodic rains of small aquatic creatures (tadpoles, frogs, small fish). No one knows where they come from.

Details
Each dot on the map is one Detail. Details act as Points according to the Wilderness Exploration rules. Keep in mind how many Watches it might take to travel to each Detail.
The Heart of a Province is always a settlement. It isn’t necessarily the largest or most important place in the setting, but it should always have a significant history.
Assume there are small villages scattered around larger settlements. These do not need to be represented by dots or Details!

Adding Details
Roll on the Settlements and Settlement Features tables to generate the Heart of the Province.
Generate features for each remaining dot except the Frontier by first rolling on the Detail Types table, then on the associated table.
For any additional Settlements rolled, roll on the Settlement Features table as well.
Generate features for the Frontier by rolling only the Special table.
If some of the results below seem incongruous, that’s OK! Turn it into a question: Why is there hazardous terrain so close to a settlement? Perhaps there were mines there once, long abandoned. Rumors as to their true treasure - and dangers - abound! That said, don’t be afraid to choose a more appropriate result if you’re having a hard time making it work!

Detail Names
Settlements are often named after their unique features: the shape of the river nearby, or the large windmill in the town center. The residents then add a noun or adjective: Windy Gulch, Black Tree Fort, Rotting Gardens, etc.
Important places (like cities) should have important names, like those of heroes, religious/political figures, and important events: The Chalet of Saint Ibiz, Queen’s Harvest, Light of the Nine, etc.
Wild and dangerous places are named after their obvious hazards: poison lake, greedy mines, etc. Some tell a story: Luka’s Folly, Dead Man’s Path, etc.

GENERATING NAMES
Starting with the Heart, roll on the Detail Names Formula table to name each Detail on the map.
Roll on the Adjectives and Nouns table where appropriate, and consult the Terrain Synonyms table for inspiration.
Refer to the Example Names for a model of each table result. [Proper Nouns] can be added to or even replace parts of a name, e.g. Bruna’s Ugly Gulch.
To roll 1d100, roll 2d10, using one die for the tens place, and one die for the ones place.

Factions
For complete rules, see here.

Factions can vary in size. Some may compete over a single Detail, while others may control one or more Details, an entire Province, or even a Domain.
The setting map should reflect the impact of Factions as they work on completing their Agendas and acquiring more Advantages (see Factions for more information).
Less is more when it comes to creating your initial Factions. A few Factions that have interests and a presence in multiple Details within your Setting are easier to manage than a dozen smaller Factions of limited scope. You can always add more if, in the process of fleshing out a Detail, it makes sense to do so.

Initial Faction Creation
First, decide how many Factions you would like to create, or refer to the Province Scale. Generally it is a good idea to have at least one Faction in each Settlement, as well as at least one headquartered out of a Lair or Ruin.
Roll on the Faction Types table to determine the nature of each Faction.
Consider the Details and Terrain you’ve developed. Place each Faction at a Detail that makes sense for its Faction Type.
Roll on the Faction Names for each Faction you have created.

FACTION TYPES
Every Faction can generally be placed in one of the following broad categories.
A Faction Type at odds with your existing Setting isn’t necessarily a problem. Some Factions are outsiders within a Province.

d12	Faction Type	Example Factions
1	Academic	Royal Topographer’s Society. An upstart cartographer’s guild, preparing to map the Far Reaches. Many have tried, but none have returned.
2	Arcane	The Syndak. A league of wizards in search of an ancient power. They cannot allow it to fall into the wrong hands.
3	Cabal	Praxis. A secret society, its machinations shrouded in mystery. But its goal is all too clear: a new world order.
4	Commoners	Unite or Perish. Together, they are strong. Together they can move mountains. But who do they really serve?
5	Criminal	Missing Fingers. An uneasy alliance of ruffians, thieves, and killers. Their boss is the most terrifying of them all.
6	Government	The Bloc. Politicians, bureaucrats, tax collectors: they are everywhere. Who are they helping, besides themselves?
7	Industrial	The Iron Pantheon. Workers, united by a charismatic and troubled leader. Fighting for a better life.
8	Mercantile	Earnest Buyer’s Club. A cartel of beaming merchants, vendors, and trade experts. Followers of none, save for the almighty coin.
9	Military	Azure Guard. Disgraced officers, relying on their only remaining assets: a soldier’s loyalty. It might be enough.
10	Noble	Lichthammer. A family built on deft politicking. Their house is in debt to a dangerous group, and they could lose everything.
11	Religious	His Noble Justice. Stewards of sacred artifacts, guided by the divine to reclaim their most holy of objects.
12	Revolutionary	Light Rising. The body politic is diseased beyond redemption. Plenty are ready to die for the cause, but only one is fit to lead them.

Non-random Province Names
Consider the following when determining the Province name:

What are the key geographic features of the region?
What major events (war, famine, discoveries) occurred here in the past? Who were the major players?
What sort of factions have historically dominated this place?
A name may also include a reference to the region’s relative position to the seat of power: The Northeast Redoubt, Western Ranges, etc.
The name (first, or family) of a “discoverer”, conqueror or colonizer often sticks around long after their death.

Conclusion
Congratulations, your Province is complete! You can now “drill down” into various locations (starting with the Heart) and build out each Detail on your own favorite tables. Keep the following thoughts in mind as you go:

How might the interactions between the Factions interact with the landscape, its features, and one another? How will this change as the Factions succeed (or fail) at their goals? Consider which Factions may be allied, and which opposed? Keep in mind the region’s history, what a Faction might have that others would want, and what someone would do to get them.
Consider the history of the region’s original “discoverers”, the locals they may have supplanted, and where both groups are today.
When building out the next Province, keep in mind how it would have interacted historically with this Province, and what might happen between them in the future.
If you find anything amiss or wrong feel free to change it, or add your own Details. Remember, it’s your setting.
