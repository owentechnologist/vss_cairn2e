Downtime
Players may utilize the following procedures between game sessions to research a question, follow-up on a lead, improve a skill, or build a relationship. Only one Downtime Action is possible at a time, and some actions may require multiple steps to complete. These actions may not be taken if the PC is not in a safe space, as well as while healing or recovering. A character cannot perform an action if it would put their safety at risk.

Milestones
Downtime Actions may require multiple steps to complete. In these cases, the Warden then provides 1-5 Milestones that the player can tick off as they make progress towards their goal. Each Milestone represents a “zoomed-out” activity that is both abstract and non-interactive. Most Milestones requires a single Downtime Action to accomplish, and potentially their own unique Cost as well. The Warden may provide the player with multiple “paths” to accomplishing their goals, each with their own unique Milestones. Over time, the Warden may add new Milestones or remove others entirely, depending on the events of the fiction.

Costs
At a minimum, every Milestone costs a single Downtime Action. If a character cannot pay the Cost, they may have to find some other way to achieve their goal. A few examples of Cost:

Gold: Direct payment of gold from a character’s inventory.
Resources: Non-monetary costs, such as material goods, specific common items, and so on.
Reputation: Betting on a character’s renown, personality, presence, social connections, etc.
Loss: Offering something specific and unique. A finger, a soul, a Relic, etc.
Some Costs can be reduced or disregarded through character skills, connections, or force of will. For example, a PC may have already acquired the necessary reputation to gain access to a renowned institution, and thus the cost is abated. On the other hand, another character may not be so lucky, and must rely on their force of personality instead. In this case, the Warden should state the risk (a permanent ban on entry, a loss of reputation, etc.). The PC then makes a WIL save; on a success the cost is either reduced or eliminated entirely.

Downtime Actions
The following activities represent some of the most common Downtime Actions a players can choose. The Warden can also create custom actions based on the needs of play.

Research
A character answers a single question about a bit of lost or forgotten lore, the location of a lost item, the whereabouts of an important NPC, and so on. To take this action the player must have a clearly formulated question they’d like to answer, and a Source of knowledge in the game world that their character can interact with. If the PC does not have a Source, then they can spend a Downtime Action trying to find one. There is no guarantee that they will be successful. Once a question is posed and an appropriate Source has been identified, the Warden should provide any Milestones and associated Costs.

QUESTIONS
As always, the question must come from an experience that occured during play. Some example questions:

“Where is the Lost Temple of East Nipoor?”
“Who in Fortune City might know how to crack an ancient vault?”
“Where can I find the cure to curly sickness?”
SOURCES
A Source is a person, place, faction, or entity that holds either a part or whole answer that the character seeks. They can be NPCs, Factions, spirits, or even other PCs.

Example Sources:

Kewr the Mouth, a frequent contact for the Conclave of Merchants. Despite their excellent relationship with this faction, asking for help in an illicit activity might come at a high cost.
A Woodwose who makes his home deep in the Forest of Knives. The party encountered him in an earlier expedition, and the encounter did not end well. Still, he is said to know the nature of every herb and their healing properties.
The Temple of Puppets, a nomadic circus troupe who have travelled the known and unknown lands. The party assisted one of their members during the Rain of Fire, when even the creatures of the Wood were preparing to flee their homes. If anyone has heard of forgotten places, it’s them.
Training
A character can improve their skills with an item or ability, with clear narrative or mechanical results. They might be interested in dealing greater damage with a particular weapon, decreasing their chances of getting lost in rough weather, or learn to read the languages of the ancients. A PC might spend multiple Downtime Actions sparring with a particular weapon, improving their skills week by week. Or they may need to travel to the home of a distant sage, improving themselves through short but intense study.

The player must describe precisely what they’d like to improve, and a Master whom they might train with. And of course, the character’s inspiration to improve should come from an experience in play. The Warden should provide any Milestones and associated Costs.

Examples:

The Two-Handed Parry: When fighting with one hand free, a PC’s HP increases by 1d4 (roll once). The party took on a hireling from the Cratered Lands, whose fighters emphasize avoiding enemy attacks. She has agreed to train anyone that can best her in hand to hand combat.
Herbology: Given proper ingredients, a PC can create a Healing Salve (restores 4 STR) as a Downtime Action. After receiving care from an elderly herbalist in the Verdant Glades, the wounded PC asked to be trained in the healing arts. The Master agreed, but asks that they collect three rare herbs before training can begin.
Troutmaster: When taking the Supply Action, Rations gathered near cold, freshwater sources increases by one step (e.g. 1d4 becomes 1d6). The party escorted a stranded naturalist from the famously dreadful Silver Wastes safely back to the city. As thanks, she offers to train a PC to identify and capture a common lakefish that frequents colder waters.
Strengthening Ties
A character fosters a connection with an NPC or Faction in the game world. First, they must identify the entity with whom they wish to strengthen ties, as well as a specific intent (e.g., building trust, mending a friendship, seeking membership in a Faction, forming an alliance, and so on). The Warden then provides concrete measures (described as Milestones and Costs) that the PC can undertake to advance the relationship. With each completed Milestone, the Warden describes how the PC’s relationship has grown or changed.

Examples:

After returning from an unsuccessful delve into the Roots, a PC discovers that they’d unknowingly brought along a stowaway: an eyeless devourer, barely hatched. They decide to keep the creature and train it in secret.
During a play session, a PC becomes friendly with the Seneschal of the Order of the Helm. Impressed by the Order’s values, the PC asks what the requirements are to join.
A powerful Seneschal died during the Battle of Frogs while under the party’s care. Now those responsible wish to provide redress, so that the party can once again perform tasks for that Faction.
