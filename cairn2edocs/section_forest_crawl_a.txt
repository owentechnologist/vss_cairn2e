Forestcrawl 

Introduction
A forestcrawl is a type of pointcrawl (see below) that focuses specifically on travel through forested zones, trying to capture the density, non-linearity, and intricate network of paths within a heavily wooded area.
A forested zone is made up of trails connecting various Details, or points of interest within a forested zone.
For an example map, jump to the bottom.
A pointcrawl is a great method for exploring complex, non-linear areas like forests, swamps, or cities, where the paths between points of interest can be labyrinthine and less easily defined than in a wide open space.

Exploring The Wood
Details in a forestcrawl are close to each other. Assume that the PCs are taking the Explore action, no matter how many locations they visit.
When travelling on clearly marked trails, a small forest zone (10-15 Details) can be explored in its entirety in a single Watch.
If the party attempts to reach a Detail by going “off-trail” (bushwhacking), the Warden should make any associated costs clear: typically time, effort (Fatigue), or any obvious dangers. Going off-trail also automatically triggers a roll on the Wilderness Events table.
If the party is interrupted, stops to investigate something, rest, etc. while exploring a forested zone, there may not be enough time to fully explore every connected Detail. In these cases, rely on the fiction and common sense to determine how much time is left in the day.

Draw The Trails
On a flat sheet of paper, draw a dot to signify the forest’s Heart.
Draw a single curving line stemming out from the Heart. This is the trunk.
Draw three branches sprouting off from the trunk.
Draw one or two short twigs from each branch. They can vary in length.
Place a dot at the terminus of every branch, trunk, or twig.
Create loops by connecting two dots to any other trail.
Number each dot, starting with the Heart.

Create The Forest
Roll on the Trail Markers table for the trunk, as well as each branch. Twigs use same trails as their respective branches. Label each trail!
Roll on the Spoor Types table for every trail. Note the spoor for each.
Follow the instructions Details section to create Details for each dot.
Roll on the Forest Encounters table for each Detail, recording and expanding on the results.
Roll on the Detail Names table, combining the results to produce a name for each Detail.
Name the forest by rolling on the Forest Names table.

TIPS
To increase the number of Details on the map, you can either add more branches and twigs, or place a dot at the intersection of lines, e.g. where the trunk meets a branch.
Create loops by adding more trails! Connect an existing Detail to another branch or the trunk.

Details
Each dot on the map is one Detail.
The Heart is where the forest is at its most powerful, its most sentient, and its most dangerous.
Each Detail is connected to its nearest neighbor by a trail, indicated by a specififc Trail Type.

Adding Details
Roll on the Special table for the Heart Detail.
Generate features for each remaining Detail by first rolling on the Detail Types table, then on the associated table.
For any Settlements rolled, roll on the Settlement Features table as well.
If some of the results below seem incongruous, that’s OK! Turn it into a question, like “Why is there an old logging road leading to the bandit’s hideout?” That said, don’t be afraid to choose a more appropriate result if you’re having a hard time making it work!

d66	Encounter
11	A woodwife gathers herbs, singing a melancholic song. She disappears into the wood if provoked.
12	An old watchtower, hidden by dense forest growth. Something larger looms just around the bend.
13	A snarling pack of wolves surround a fresh kill. They are not keen to share.
14	A massive boulder blocks the path ahead. It is actually a buried troll, turned to stone by the sun.
15	A wide river where otters are playing with something shiny. It appears to be a small suit of armor.
16	A circle of perfect mushrooms. Blue-white wings flutter between, their wings humming a hypnotic tune.
21	A gnarled tree trunk with an uncannily carved face on its trunk.
22	Naiads splashing in a small pond. Their teeth are fanged, like daggers.
23	A hillside cave, wafting the scent of damp and decay. Within, a stone statue of some forgotten deity.
24	A trap, hastily set and poorly concealed. It smells strongly of urine.
25	A tree acting as makeshift bridge over a glittering stream. It appears sturdy.
26	Bees swarm protectively around a tree brimming with honeycombs. A cloaked figure silently observes nearby.
31	Wild berries grow here in abundance. None have been eaten, not even by birds.
32	Shadowy figures dart between the trees. Hushed voices call out to one another.
33	A wounded animal, whining pitifully and limping. There is intelligence in its eyes.
34	A spectacular waterfall, spraying rainbows high. A silver horn splits the cascade, its owner obscured.
35	A dense thicket of thorns, nearly impassable. Something shiny glints just beyond.
36	A patch of quicksand disguised as soft ground. A broken spool of rope lies nearby.
41	A trio of ravens circle ominously overhead. Suddenly they burst into action, diving down into the bush.
42	A dryad sits atop a stone, a purple fungus lining her arms. There is a violence to her eyes.
43	A great oak has been felled, perhaps by lightning. A large hole is rent on one side.
44	A troll sits holding a mirror, engaged in deep conversation with its own reflection.
45	A tiny hovel is nestled in a tree’s roots. The smell of baking bread wafts out.
46	A lone woodwose stands directly on the path ahead, holding a large stick.
51	A trio of satyrs playing and dancing to music. They seem ignorant of any observation.
52	A windless glade with a large willow at the center. It sways softly, as if to some unseen breeze.
53	Sleeping peacefully atop two boughts, a giant is snoring. The ground vibrates in response.
54	Dozens of smallfolk have setup a market here, trading forest goods. Their wares are impressive.
55	A robed woman is tending to a wounded animal, whispering in its ear.
56	A fairy circle, covered in black moss. Something about it feels off.
61	A small bearded man argues with a squawking raven. It holds something shiny in its beak.
62	A tree, all but consumed by blight. In its boughs, something cries out as if trapped.
63	The path ends at a small pond. The water looks pure, but something moves subtly within.
64	A circle of standing stones, overgrown with moss. No grass grows in their shadow.
65	In the crook of a hollow tree, six ravens squawk and preen. If observed they stare back in silence.
66	A rotted, vine-covered cabin, clearly abandoned long ago. A delicious smell wafts from the window.

Naming Details
To create a name each Detail, combine the results from the first column (adjectives) with the results from the second column (nouns).
For the adjective, roll a d10 twice, first for the tens place, and then another for the ones place. Then repeat the process for the noun.
Feel free to combine two nouns, or an adjective and a terrain type

TIPS & CHANGES
Change it up! The name Welcoming Grove creates a more vivid image than Beckoning Copse might.
Use contrasting words (e.g. Twisted Canopy) to evoke an interesting detail about the location.
Make it sound nice. Alliteration and pleasing combinations can create pleasant sounds. Whispering Woods is more pleasing to the ear than Tangled Woods.
