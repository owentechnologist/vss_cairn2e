Some games rely on “Initiative” to determine who goes first when combat begins. In Cairn, the PCs must each make a DEX save in order to act before their opponents. After that round has been concluded, the two “sides” each take turns attacking, their individual members acting in whatever order they wish. In some cases a DEX save may not be necessary, especially when the PC or NPC was on guard or ready for an attack.

A standard combat scenario would work like this:

Round 1
PCs make a DEX save. Those who successfully pass go before the enemies (collectively one “side”). They go in whatever order they wish; the results however are simultaneous.
All enemies go, in whatever order the Warden chooses; the results are simultaneous.
Round 2
All PCs (including those that failed the original DEX save) get to go in whatever order they wish. The results however are simultaneous.
All enemies get to go in whatever order the Warden chooses; the results however are simultaneous.
Round 3
All PCs get to go, as per round 2.
All enemies get to go, as per round 2.
And so on.
