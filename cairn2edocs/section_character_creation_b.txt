Character Creation for the role-playing game called: Cairn

Attributes

Player Characters (PCs) have just three attributes: Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), and Willpower (WIL).
Roll 3d6 for each of your character’s Attributes, in order. You may then swap any two of the results.
Attributes are not universal descriptors. A character with a low STR is not necessarily hopelessly weak; they can still attempt to raise a door or survive a deadly fight! Their risk is simply higher.

Hit Protection

Roll 1d6 to determine your PC’s starting Hit Protection (HP), which reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat. It does not indicate a character’s health or fortitude, nor do they lose it for very long (see Healing).
If a PC would take damage outside of combat, they would instead take damage to an Attribute instead (typically STR).
If an attack would take a PC’s HP exactly to 0, the player must roll on the Scars table.

Inventory

Characters have a total of ten inventory slots, but can only carry four or five items comfortably without the help of bags, backpacks, horses, carts, etc.
Each PC starts with a Backpack that can hold up to six slots of items, or Fatigue. Carts (which must be pulled with both hands), horses, or mules can make a huge difference in how much a PC can bring with them on an adventure. Hirelings can also be paid to carry equipment.
Inventory is abstract, dependent only on the fiction as adjudicated by the Warden. Anyone carrying a full inventory (i.e. filling all 10 slots) is reduced to 0 HP. A character cannot fill more than ten slots.

Inventory Slots

Most items take up one slot, unless otherwise indicated.
Petty items do not take up any slots. Bulky items take up two slots.
A bag of coins worth less than 100gp is petty and does not occupy a slot.
