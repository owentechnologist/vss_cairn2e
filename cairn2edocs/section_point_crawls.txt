Pointcrawls
Creating a Pointcrawl
Number any potential points of interest on the map.
Identify potential routes between each point, noting obvious roads and trails. Indicate any sites that lack connecting routes to other points.
Indicate the rough travel time (in days) between any two points, accounting for the partyâ€™s speed, terrain, weather, and other elements of play that might affect the journey.

POINTCRAWL EXAMPLE

A map showing several interesting points and the distance between them is used here.

The travel times between each point were determined as follows (assuming that the party is travelling by foot):

The journey between points 1 to 2 is 6 watches:
Add one watch for the trail through the mountains and forests.
Add three watches for the Perilous mountain terrain, and 2 watches for the forest.
The journey between 2 and 3 takes 4 watches:
Add one watch for the trail through the mountains.
Add three watches for the Perilous mountain terrain.
The journey between 2 and 4 takes three watches:
No penalty for traveling on a maintained road.
Add two watches for the Tough forest terrain.
Add one additional watch for the extra long forest journey.
The journey between 4 and 5 takes four watches:
Add one watch for the trail through the swamp.
Add one watch for the Perilous swamp terrain.
The journey between 4 and 6 takes 3 watches:
Add one watch for the trail through the woods.
Add two watches for the Tough forest terrain.
The journey to 7 from anywhere should consider:
+2 for traveling through the wilderness
+2 for traveling through the Tough forest terrain.
+1 watch if traveling from further away.
