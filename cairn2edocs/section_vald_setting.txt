Vald

Introduction
The implied/default setting of Cairn is called Vald. This includes all developed or settled lands, cities, towns, etc. The particular ruler does not matter.
The Wood surrounds and divides the kingdoms, and includes anyone (or anything) that has not yet sworn fealty. The Woods is not one forest, but all forests.
The Roots is the realm of mystery and horror underneath, and does not care for the petty divisions overground.

The Woods
Any lands beyond the control of a noble, a city, or a town. Typically wilder and less “civilized.” All forests are considered part of The Woods, no matter how isolated.
The Woods are populated by creatures far stranger and wondrous than humankind: Fae, Demons, Witches, werewolves, and even talking plants and animals. They do not appreciate the loss of their home from the encroachment of “natural” progress, either.
The denizens of The Woods are fiercely independent, believing they are subject solely to the rules of The Woods and no other.Its fierce nations, wild tribes, and unrelenting elements have kept armies and scouting parties at bay. For now.

The Roots
Remnants of the Old World, its labyrinthine hollows stretching for immeasurable distances deep underground, connecting the sewers of the cities to the far-flung ruins. Entrances to The Roots (called Gates) are scattered across the lands, and are usually protected or shrewdly hidden.
Only the brave or foolish have dared enter The Roots, in search of forgotten Relics or powerful Spellbooks. The few that return whisper of unspeakable terrors guarding these lost treasures.
Folktales recount that traveling through The Roots bends the natural order of things. Stories tell of adventurers lost for centuries to the depths, only to emerge again claiming that only a few hours have passed. Others have claimed to make a week-long journey above ground in just one day, traveling in the tunnels beneath.

On Naming
For the first name, roll on each table respectively, then combine. Then use the format:
If they hail from a city or town, use their background or profession, e.g. “Paela Miller,” or the first name of a parent (roll another name), e.g. “Leni Lio.”
If they hail from The Woods, use the name of their hometown, e.g. “Faroelel of Sundew Glade,” or a title, e.g. “JaraSif the Mighty.”
If they hail from The Roots, create three names and combine them, e.g. “Lylethor Sorin Tal,” or dashes, between the second and third syllables, e.g. “Penu-Flor.”

Creating Location Names
Roll on the table for the appropriate Domain.
Roll a d66 on each table twice, first for the adjective and then for the noun.
Combine the results to create a name! You can also mix in a randomly rolled Name with the results.

Tips & Changes
Be specific! “Golden Barley” creates a more vivid image than “Golden Fields.”
Use contrasting words (e.g. “Thorny Meadows”) to evoke an interesting detail about the location.
Make it sound nice. Alliteration and pleasing combinations can create pleasant sounds. “Babbling Brook” is more pleasing than “Rambling Brook.”
