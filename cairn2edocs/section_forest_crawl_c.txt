Cairn role playing game guide:

An Example of creating a forest

Draw Trails
We start by creating the structure of our forest, drawing the first dot representing the Heart in the central, Southern part of the region.
We then draw the trunk, creating a gentle curve towards the Northwest.
Then we draw three branches extending from the trunk, one towards the East (closer to the Heart) and the other towards the West and further North.
We then draw a single twig off of each branch.
We draw a dot at every terminal point.
Finally we connect two dots to other trails in our forest.

Number Dots
First we assign numbers, starting with the Heart at 11. In total, we have 7 dots for the Details:
1 is our Heart.
2 is at the beginning (or end) of the trunk.
4, 5, and 6, are each at the end of a branch.
3 and 7 are each at the end of twigs, to the East and West of the trunk respectively.

Assign Trail Markers
For each trail we’ll roll on the Trail Markers table (d12):

For the trunk we got a 6 (Old Logging Road).
For the Eastern branch closest to the Heart we got a 3 (Fae Passage).
For the Western branch closest to the Heart we got a 4 (Bandit’s Run).
For the Eastern branch farthest from the Heart we got a 5 (Pilgrim’s Footpath).
For the loopeing trails that we made last, we got a 12 (War Route) and a 7 (Trail Tree).

Assign Trail Spoor
For each Trail we roll on the Spoor Types table.
For the Old Logging Road we rolled a 4 (Enormous Footprints).
For the Fae Passage we rolled a 12 (Fresh Spiderwebs).
For the Bandit’s Run we rolled a 13 (Archaic Tree Carvings).
For the Pilgrim’s Footpath we rolled an 18 (Swaying Plants).
For the War Route we rolled a 14 (Dozens of Stone Piles)
For the Trail Tree we rolled a 13 (Claw Marks).

Assign Details
Next we’ll roll on the provided tables to generate features for each Detail. First roll a d20 on the Special table to create the Heart (1). We got an 11 (Elf Queen’s Pavilion).

For each remaining Detail, we first roll on the Detail Types table, then on the associated table:

Detail (2): We roll a d6: a 4 (Hazard). Now we roll a d12 on the Hazards table: a 6 (Thorny Thickets).
Detail (3): We roll a d6: a 5 (Landmark). Now we roll a d12 on the Landmarks table: an 11 (Cathedral of Trees).
Detail (4): We roll a d6: 1 (Settlement). Now we roll a d12 on the Settlement table: a 9 (Monastic Retreat). We also roll on the Settlement Features table with a d20: a 20 (Renowned for its scholars).
Detail (5): We roll a d6: 2 (Ruins). Roll a d12 on the Ruins table: a 4 (Crumbled Crypt).
Detail (6): We roll a d6: 3 (Lair). Roll a d12 on the Lairs table: an 8 (Goblin Hideaway).
Detail (7): We roll a d6: 6 (Special). Roll a d20 on the Special table: a 5 (Will-o’-Wisps).

Create Encounters
Next, we create forest encounters by rolling a d20 on the Forest Encounters table for each Detail.

We roll an 8: Naiads splashing in a small pond. Their teeth are fanged, like daggers.
We roll a 17: A dense thicket of thorns, nearly impassable.
We roll a 15: A wounded animal, whining pitifully as it limps.

We roll a 3: A snarling pack of wolves surrounding a fresh kill.
We roll a 6: A circle of perfect mushrooms. Blue-white wings flutter between.

Detail Naming
We will now name each Detail using the Detail Names table. I took some liberties here, smashing together words I liked with other words from the list.

Heart (Elf Queen’s Pavilion): Glintleaf Dell
(Thorny Thickets): Thistlefield
(Cathedral of Trees): Timbertop Spire
(Monastic Retreat): Cloister of the Quiet Wood
(Crumbled Crypt): Shattered Barrow
(Goblin Hideaway): Mossbreak Nook
(Will-o’-Wisps): Glimmerglade
Naming Our Forest
Finally, we roll on the Forest Names table, getting a 4 and then a 6 (or 46) for the adjective, “Luminous”. Then we roll again, getting a 10 and a 5 (or 15) for the noun, “Weald.” Our forest is called The Luminous Weald.
