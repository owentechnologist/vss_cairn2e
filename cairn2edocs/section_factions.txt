Factions Overview
Rules for initially generating Factions for your setting can be found here.
Factions possess Advantages that allow them to accomplish their goals, the culmination of which will result in fulfilling their Agendas.
All Factions also face Obstacles, which prevent them from easily accomplishing their Agendas
A Faction may be governed by a one or more powerful figures, but most of the time PCs will be dealing with subordinates known as Seneschals.
Factions will work to complete their Agendas independently, enlisting the help of PCs only when advantageous.
The setting map should reflect the impact of Factions as they work on completing their Agendas and acquiring more Advantages.

FACTIONS CREATION PROCEDURE
First, follow the initial Factions Creation instructions found in Setting, if you have yet to do so.
Follow steps 1-5 for each Faction.

Consider how many Advantages a Faction would have (between 2-4) based on their Faction Type and roll accordingly on the Faction Advantages table. Flesh out the specifics of the Advantages as indicated by the results from the table.
Roll on the Faction Agendas table and consider what their specific Agenda may be given your current information.
Roll on the Faction Obstacles table. Use the result to consider what might prevent the Agenda from succeeding.
Establish a series of 3-4 goals that must be accomplished for this Agenda to be accomplished. See Goals below.
Create at least one Seneschal, inspired by the Faction type, Advantages, and Agenda, and Obstacle that were generated. Place them at the Faction’s home base, or at a Detail where the interests of the Faction lie.
Do not feel limited by the table results below. If something feels “off” or a different table result would work better for your setting, use it!

Advantages
Advantages reflect a Faction’s influence, materials, wealth, and unique features. Advantages are best interpreted through the lens of Faction Type.
Factions add or lose Advantages by trying to complete their Agenda (see below).
Factions leverage Advantages as much as possible to achieve their goals, and at the same time work to acquire more Advantages.

d12	Advantage Type	Example Advantages	Example Seneschals
1	Anonymity	A secret society shrouded in mystery, its members’ identities unknown.	Monks, politicians, demi-gods
2	Apparatus	A powerful Relic, artifact, or tool.	Scholars, philosophers, sages
3	Fealty	Enjoys the loyalty of a large or important bloc of people.	Lords, bannermen, farmers
4	Force	Employs brawn as its voice, and brute force as the cudgel.	Bullies, toughs, flatfoots
5	Information	Keeps tabs on friends and enemies alike via espionage and arcane privileges.	Spies, informants, mystics
6	Magic	Relies on the arcane arts to carry out its agenda.	Wizards, spellswords, liches
7	Population	Boasts a large number of rank and file members.	Gangs, urchins, peddlers
8	Position	Relies on a unique geographic or political immunity.	Outlanders, criminals, politicians
9	Resources	Keeps sway over properties, assets, or source of power.	Workers, thugs, academics
10	Renown	Part of a de-facto regime, respected or feared.	Nobles, merchants, generals
11	Subterfuge	Moves unseen, achieving its goals through a cloak-and-dagger approach.	Assassins, tricksters, thieves
12	Wealth	Affluent, using its riches to extend their influence and protect themselves.	Soldiers, officials, merchants

Agendas
Agendas are accomplished through the completion of goals that work toward a clear objective or purpose. They are rooted in desire: that for power, wealth, revenge, resources, etc.
Agendas should not be small things. Their successful completion should potentially change the landscape of a setting.
If a Faction completes an Agenda, either roll another one or choose the option from the table that is best supported by developments in the fiction.

d12	Agenda	Example Agendas
1	Collect	Bring together ancient artifacts once thought lost.
2	Defend	Protect a person, place or thing at all costs.
3	Destroy	Eliminate a rival faction, artifact, or person.
4	Domination	Bring disparate factions under the same leadership, and then expand.
5	Enrich	Concentrate as much wealth in the faction’s coffers as possible.
6	Infiltrate	Place members in other factions, asserting control from within.
7	Overthrow	Replace the current leadership with themselves.
8	Preserve	Maintain the status quo, whatever the cost. Order isn’t cheap.
9	Purge	Rid the land of a custom, belief, or people.
10	Revenge	Rectify a perceived injustice. Direct experience unnecessary.
11	Reveal	Disclose a long-kept secret, not necessarily for personal gain.
12	Revive	Restore a former leader, god, or locale and pay it tribute.

Obstacles
All Agendas have at least one Obstacle that stands in the way of their completion.
Additional Obstacles can arise through Faction Actions (see below) or through developments in the fiction.

d12	Obstacles	Example Obstacles
1	Dog Eat Dog	Another Faction is vying for the same or similar Agenda.
2	Cloak & Dagger	The Agenda must be carried out in absolute secrecy.
3	Guardian at the Gate	A powerful figure or foe must be eliminated to ensure a successful Agenda.
4	Consequnces are Dire	The Agenda contravenes an established code. Violation pays a heavy penalty.
5	Special Set of Skills	Accomplishing the Agenda requires specialists of an uncommon sort.
6	Tools for the Job	A particular object or Relic is required to complete the Agenda.
7	Perfect Timing	The Agenda must be carried out at a rare or exact moment.
8	Public Perception	A significant portion of the population openly opposes the Agenda.
9	Opposition	Another Faction opposes the Agenda, and will attempt to stop it.
10	Limited Means	Considerable capital will be required to carry out the Agenda.
11	Rotten from Within	The Faction has a been infiltrated by a spy, intent on sabotage.
12	Body Count	Someone must die to ensure a successful outcome. The Agenda demands it.

Goals
Goals are progressive, each building on the previous successes (or failures) of earlier goals.
Most goals should focus on acquiring a distinct Advantage in order to proceed to the next goal.
At least one goal should deal with the Faction’s primary Obstacle (see above). This may be the first goal, or the last.

Seneschals
Seneschals are often in charge of completing one or more of the goals of the Agenda of a Faction.
Particularly large Factions may have additional Seneschals, often with each in charge of a different set of Resources
Small Factions may have a single leader that acts as Seneschal, and may even be a Faction of one!
Often Seneschals will have personal motivations that differ from the Faction’s main Agenda, a fact that canny PCs can exploit for their own gain.

Example Faction
Academic: Royal Cartographer’s Guild
Base: Seaside Athenaeum
Advantages
Apparatus: A Map of the Dead. It opens a path to the underworld, and to the secrets of the dead.
Position: The Seaside Athenaeum is both well-defended and steeped in forbidden secrets.
Renown: None would dare defy the Guild publicly. Their voice carries great weight in the kingdom.
Seneschals: Dr. Horatia Confi, first order. Discovered the Map of the Dead. Stats as human (WIL 15).
Agenda: Destroy. The Guild has long been at war with the Holy Order of Yix (figuratively and otherwise) for over a century. It is time their ignorant sect was brought to its knees. The Order is currently favored by the monarchy, but that could all change.
Hire a skilled party, and lead them to the Gates of the Underworld. Dr. Confi will lead the expedition.
Travel through the lands of the dead in search of the Order’s founder, and force their to reveal an ancient secret.
Reveal the founder’s secrets - including their true identity - to the monarchy. Tie up any loose ends, including witnesses.
Obstacle: Rotten From Within. The Guild has received legitimate intelligence that a well-placed operative moves within their ranks, and is aware of the coming operation.
Faction Rules

By default, Factions operate independent of the player character’s actions. If the PCs do nothing, the Factions should still act to achieve their aims.
Whenever a Faction is positioned to advance a goal in their Agenda, roll a d12 on the Faction Actions table.
If two Factions are opposed, the Faction most at risk makes a WIL save, using the score of its highest-ranking Seneschal.
On a success, the Faction most at risk rolls on the Faction Actions table, and their opponent does not.
On a fail, the Faction most at risk does not roll on the Faction Actions table, but their opponent does.
The Warden should rely on the fiction to determine whether a Faction is positioned to advance their Agenda. Goals may be time-sensitive or depend on explicit circumstances. Other times it might be more appropriate after a major event, alliance, or friction between one or more Factions, etc.

Faction Actions
d12	Consequence	Impact
1-2	Failure	A new Obstacle is introduced, and a Advantage is lost.
3-4	Setback	An Advantage is lost.
5-6	Status Quo	Nothing is gained, but nothing is lost.
7-8	Mixed Success	A goal is achieved, but an Advantage is lost.
9-10	Success	A goal is achieved, and no Advantages are lost.
11-12	Major Success	A goal is achieved, and a new Advantage is found.
The actions of the PCs can always overrule the necessity for a Faction action, or in some cases shift the outcome of the roll in a favorable or unfavorable direction.
