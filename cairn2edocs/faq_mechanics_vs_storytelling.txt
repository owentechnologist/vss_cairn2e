The realities of the game’s fiction should always take precedence over mechanics. Occasionally the details of a particular scene (such as a PC or NPC’s knowledge or abilities) will render a mechanic or rule obsolete. If a short-legged thief attempts to leap across an impossible gap, there is no save. They simply fall into the abyss. Likewise if that same thief were to try to knock unconscious an oblivious & defenseless guard, it just happens. There is no need for a roll.
