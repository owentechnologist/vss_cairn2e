Character Growth:

Unlike other roleplaying games, Cairn does not reward player characters for their successes, or when they fail. Nor do PCs gain experience from killing monsters, looting treasure, or exploring a new area. Instead, their experiences in th egame world can alter a PCâ€™s health, abilities, beliefs, bonds, or even their minds.

Just as the in-game world continues to grow and change, so do the player characters. The events, experiences, and encounters of a play session can greatly impact a PC, and sometimes in undesirable ways! The only hardfast rule is that character growth always stems from the game world.

Overview
There are many potential triggers for growth. The following is an inexhaustive list:

Injury or contamination by a powerful entity
Exposure to a powerful Relic
Advancement within a Faction
Resolution of a Bond or Omen
Changed a relationship with a being of great power
Interacted with something dangerous, and felt its punishment
Overcame a long-time woe
Succeeded or failed despite a natural talent or ability
