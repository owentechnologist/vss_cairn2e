CairnRPG is a rules system for a story-driven role-playing-game.  The primary goal of the game is to have fun as a group.

The person who runs the campaign for the game is called the Warden.

CairnRPG Core Rules:

Character Attributes:
Each of the three attributes are used in different circumstances (see saves, below).

Strength (STR): Used for saves requiring physical power, like lifting gates, bending bars, resisting poison, etc.
Dexterity (DEX): Used for saves requiring poise, speed, and reflexes like dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.
Willpower (WIL): Used for saves to persuade, deceive, interrogate, intimidate, charm, provoke, manipulate spells, etc.

Saves
A save is a roll to avoid bad outcomes from risky choices and circumstances.
PCs roll a d20 and compare the results to an appropriate attribute. If they roll equal to or under that attribute, they pass. Otherwise, they fail.
A 1 is always a success, and a 20 is always a failure.
