Character Creation for the role-playing game called: Cairn

Roll or choose a Background

First, roll on the Backgrounds table below. Note the roll result, as you will need to refer to it for the next few steps.
Choose a name from the available list, then roll on each of the included tables in the background. Record your character’s items, skills, or abilities from each result.
Unless otherwise noted, every PC starts with a Torch (3 uses), Rations (3 uses), and 3d6 gold pieces. See the core rules for how to record items.
Some backgrounds may ask you to refer to tables on the Marketplace as well.

Attributes, HP & Traits
Roll for your character’s Attributes and Hit Protection.
Roll for the rest of your character’s Traits, and then on the the Bonds table.
Finally, roll for your character’s Age (2d20+10). If you are the youngest character, roll on the Omens table. The result should be read aloud to the other players.
