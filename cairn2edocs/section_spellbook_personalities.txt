Cairn roleplaying game guide:

Spells found in Spellbooks

1	Adhere	An object is covered in extremely sticky slime.	Adjacent objects (including Spellbooks) stick to the book with great force, and must be pried off gently.
2	Anchor	A strong wire sprouts from your arms, affixing itself to two points within 50ft on each side.	Drawing a rope through the iron loop on its spine makes the Spellbook weigh as much as an elephant.
3	Animate Object	An object obeys your commands as best it can.	The cover is moldable like clay. Occasional childish laughter sprouts from its pages from time to time.
4	Anthropomorphize	An animal either gains human intelligence or human appearance for one day.	The book whimpers, purrs and growls depending on its treatment.
5	Arcane Eye	You can see through a magical floating eyeball that flies around at your command.	Circular; closed with a long string. Can be worn as an eyepatch.
6	Astral Prison	An object is frozen in time and space within an invulnerable crystal shell.	Crystalline purple binding. Abstract faces stare through a tortoise-shell surface, screaming at the reader noiselessly.
7	Attract	Two objects are strongly magnetically attracted to each other if they come within 10 feet.	Nearby compasses spin uselessly, and if dropped, the Spellbook always points towards True North.
8	Auditory Illusion	You create illusory sounds that seem to come from a direction of your choice.	Thin and wrapped in a thick, cloth-like paper. The cover does little to muffle random and occasionally comical sounds it produces throughout the day.
9	Babble	A creature must loudly and clearly repeat everything you think. It is otherwise mute.	While holding the book, the words of others are opaque and difficult to understand.
10	Bait Flower	A plant sprouts from the ground that emanates the smell of decaying flesh.	The book itself produces no smell at all, not even of paper. Somehow, it still seems to attract any beasts that hunt flesh.
11	Beast Form	You and your possessions transform into a mundane animal.	Covered in thick fur, with small teeth lining the edges. The book can be thrown, doing d6 STR damage to its target.
12	Befuddle	A creature of your choice is unable to form new short-term memories for the duration of the spell.	With each use, the book adds a paragraph to its appendix, describing a loving memory from the target’s past.
13	Body Swap	You switch bodies with a creature you touch. If one body dies, the other dies as well.	The cover (including any relevant text or images) changes after each use, swapped with another book in this plane.
14	Charm	A creature you can see treats you as a friend.	Appears non-descript and mundane to enemies of the current owner. Smells faintly of jasmine.
15	Command	A target obeys a single three-word command that does not cause it harm.	Long-time keepers of this unadorned black volume will gradually detect mysterious whispers emanating from it, asking them to perform odd tasks with seemingly no purpose. They will find it hard to resist, eventually.
16	Comprehend	You become fluent in all languages for a short while.	Wooden pages tied together with strong catgut. Over time, other books exposed to prolonged contact begin to turn blank, as if their words have seeped out.
17	Cone of Foam	Dense foam sprays from your hand, coating the target.	The book is spongy and faintly moist to the touch. Leaves behind a soapy residue.
18	Control Plants	Nearby plants and trees obey you and gain the ability to move at a slow pace.	Large, leafy-green pages glued along the spines. Smells faintly of decay.
19	Control Weather	You may alter the type of weather at will, but you do not otherwise control it.	Over time, the book changes its cover to suit various weather patterns (protection from heat, wet, snow, etc). Its schedule is unpredictable, as if obeying the weather elsewhere - another place, another land, or perhaps even another world.
20	Cure Wounds	Restore 1d4 STR per day to a creature you can touch.	Pure-white thick with bandage-like paper. The last page is perforated and can be torn off to use as a bandage, which re-appears after the Spellbook’s next use. It smells of vinegar and thyme.
21	Deafen	All nearby creatures are deafened.	A soft, velvety book that produces no noise upon touch, not even at the turning of a page. Nearby instruments sound off, as if notes were falling from the air.
22	Detect Magic	You can see or hear nearby magical auras.	The cover is delicate and parchment-like, a sphere is scrawled into its center. The book becomes warm to the touch if a magic is used in the vicinity.
23	Disassemble	Any of your body parts may be detached and reattached at will, without causing pain or damage. You can still control them.	Even torn to pieces, the book will eventually reform, its pages and cover slowly coming together again.
24	Disguise	You may alter the appearance of one character at will as long as they remain humanoid. Attempts to duplicate other characters will seem uncanny.	Pressing the book too closely against another will create a mirror image of the other, shifting its size, shape and color to adapt.
25	Displace	An object appears to be up to 15ft from its actual position.	Never where you last left it. Occasionally bits of string, clothing and leaves are found within its pages.
26	Earthquake	The ground begins shaking violently. Structures may be damaged or collapse.	The cover is somehow liquid, small ripples emerging from its center. The book is hard to keep open, its spine shifting violently to and from its pages.
27	Elasticity	Your body can stretch up to 10ft.	Solid and immutable, like hardened steel. The pages are extremely heavy.
28	Elemental Wall	A straight wall of ice or fire 50ft long and 10ft high rises from the ground.	Smells of sulfur. Sometimes the cover leaves a burning residue on exposed skin; other times it is as cold as ice.
29	Filch	A visible item teleports to your hands.	The cover is black and non-descript with no lettering or images. Occasionally a nearby ally’s prized possessions may be found stuck inside the back pages.
30	Flare	A bright ball of energy fires a trail of light into the sky, revealing your location to friend or foe.	Three wriggly lines are drawn on the cover. The book glows faintly in complete darkness.
31	Fog Cloud	A dense fog spreads out from you.	Made of extremely thin glass that folds open. Can be cast with only one hand, but is very easy to shatter.
32	Frenzy	A nearby creature erupts in a frenzy of violence.	Rough, sandpaper cover that destroys any book it touches. Holding without gloves can cause bloody fingers.
33	Gate	A portal to a random plane opens.	A door is cut into the cover, revealing the first page, as well as a series of other pages within. Each successive page opened reveals another part of the spell, requiring a full flip-through to cast.
34	Gravity Shift	You can change the direction of gravity, but only for yourself.	Objects lighter than the book are slowly pulled towards it. It can be a trifle annoying to pack away with other things.
35	Greed	A creature develops the overwhelming urge to possess a visible item of your choice.	The cover shifts to show the viewer whatever their heart desires most at the present moment, no matter how well-hidden. Staring at it too long can cause a stupor.
36	Haste	Your movement speed is tripled.	A small raptor is carved into the leather cover. The pages are fluid and difficult to hold on to while reading. Beware papercuts.
37	Hatred	A creature develops a deep hatred of another creature or group and wishes to destroy them.	A tree is drawn on the front cover, bearing a large fruit in its leafy branches. Long term exposure to the book can cause suspicion, paranoia and distrust amongst even the greatest of friends.
38	Hear Whispers	You can hear faint sounds clearly.	Flipping the book upside down into a “tent” shape and speaking into the crevasse amplifies the voice of even the quietest of speakers.
39	Hover	An object hovers, frictionless, 2ft above the ground. It can hold up to one humanoid.	A small grey book; it floats if dropped mid-air.
40	Hypnotize	A creature enters a trance and will truthfully answer one yes or no question you ask it.	The book cover generates a hypnotic effect, like swirling circles. The reader must be quick or be caught under its spell.
41	Icy Touch	A thick ice layer spreads across a touched surface, up to 10ft in radius.	Slides across the surface of water as if upon ice, without getting wet.
42	Identify Owner	Letters appear over the object you touch, spelling out the name of the object’s owners, if there are any.	The 1st page shows the latest user’s full name and all aliases, in their handwriting.
43	Illuminate	A floating light moves as you command.	Despite its mundane appearance, the book behaves like a prism, allowing light to pass through and splitting it into a vibrant rainbow.
44	Invisible Tether	Two objects within 10ft of each other cannot be moved more than 10ft apart.	The thin metal covers of this book have no spine, but behave as if they do. When the covers are pulled apart with force, the pages float evenly between.
45	Knock	A nearby mundane or magical lock unlocks loudly.	An old brass lock holding the book shut can only be opened with a randomly selected key from nearby. A new key is chosen each day.
46	Leap	You jump up to 10ft high, once.	This battered tome will fall quickly to the ground at terminal velocity if ever dropped. When used, the caster is guaranteed to have a nightmare about falling the next time they sleep.
47	Liquid Air	The air around you becomes swimmable .	Looking at the ornate cover will make one feel as if they cannot breathe, only relieved by drinking water.
48	Magic Dampener	All nearby magical effects have their effectiveness halved.	Those in possession of this book will gradually find themselves repulsed by all sources of magic, eventually seeking to destroy them.
49	Manse	A sturdy, furnished cottage appears for hours You can permit and forbid entry to it at will.	Bound in plush, homely carpet, the tome vanishes upon use, appearing somewhere within the conjured cottage. If left inside when the cottage disappears, it cannot be recovered.
50	Marble Craze	Your pockets are full of marbles, and will refill every 30 seconds.	Despite the contents only being paper, this book will make a playful rattling sound when shaken, much like a pouch of many marbles.
51	Masquerade	A characters appearance and voice becomes identical to those of a character you touch.	The book cover is a simple mirror. When looked into, one will see a more beautiful version of themself, appearing to speak to them. Though the viewer cannot hear, they feel they are being mocked for their inadequacies.
52	Miniaturize	A creature you touch is shrunk down to the size of a mouse.	The text of this book is so small a magnifying glass is required for reading. When opened, the holder is hit with heavy pangs of vertigo.
53	Mirror Image	An illusory duplicate of yourself appears and is under your control.	The contents of this book shift every time it is opened, leaving vast swaths of empty pages at random intervals.
54	Mirrorwalk	A mirror becomes a gateway to another mirror that you looked into today.	The book cover is a door like one would expect to see on a hut. It will not open until knocked upon politely.
55	Multiarm	You temporarily gain an extra arm.	This book cannot be opened, nor the pages turned, whilst being touched with more than one hand. After use, the caster is wracked with phantom limb syndrome for a day.
56	Night Sphere	A 50ft wide sphere of darkness displaying the night sky appears before you.	The navy cover shows the most prominent constellation currently in the sky. The user, however, becomes unable to see any stars for a week, save those in the Night Sphere.
57	Objectify	You become any inanimate object between the size of a grand piano and an apple.	Those who possess this book will begin to see faces on objects more and more often. At times, they appear to be screaming.
58	Ooze Form	You become a living jelly.	Liquids in the vicinity of this book begin to thicken to a jelly-like consistency, only reversed to normal by heating enough to boil. When the pages are flipped, a delicious, fruity odor is released.
59	Pacify	A creature near you has an aversion to violence.	The edges of the rusty, metal covers are razor sharp like that of a blade. It is useable as weapon, dealing 1d4 damage. The contents appear to be written in blood.
60	Phobia	A nearby creature becomes terrified of an object of your choice.	1 hour after use, the caster will freeze in place, shaking uncontrollably, despite any absence of the emotion of fear. The effect persists longer after each use.
61	Pit	A pit 10ft wide and 10ft deep opens in the ground.	The covers of the book are comprised of tightly bound rope, with a metal piton as the spine. It can be unravelled to a length of 10ft.
62	Primal Surge	A creature rapidly evolves into a future version of its species.	The user will only be able to speak in an overbearingly condescending tone for a day after casting.
63	Push/Pull	An object of any size is pulled directly towards you or pushed directly away from you with the strength of one man.	All force placed upon the book and it’s pages is comically amplified. If thrown, it will travel thrice the expected difference.
64	Raise Dead	A skeleton rises from the ground to serve you. They are incredibly stupid and can only obey simple orders.	Upon the cover is an image of a human skeleton performing a spirited dance. The owner of this book will gradually become fixated on corpses and death, to the point of wishing to collect bones.
65	Raise Spirit	The spirit of a nearby corpse manifests and will answer 1 question.	When any creature capable of speaking dies within the vicinity of this book, their final words are inscribed within with rich purple ink.
66	Read Mind	You can hear the surface thoughts of nearby creatures.	Those in possession of this tome will gradually begin to adopt the involuntary habits of anyone they encounter, such as whistling songs, twirling their hair, eating food in a particular order, etc.
67	Repel	Two objects are strongly magnetically repelled from each other within 10 feet.	This book can never be closed, even with incredible force, as the covers constantly repel each other. Makes for a good springboard.
68	Scry	You can see through the eyes of a creature you touched earlier today.	After use, the caster’s eyes will permanently change color to any other found in their species.
69	Sculpt Elements	Inanimate material behaves like clay in your hands.	Each page is covered in dusty, clay-like matter, that must be scratched away to read the contents. It reappears whenever the book is closed.
70	Sense	Choose one kind of object (key, gold, arrow, jug, etc). You can sense the nearest example.	The last user of the book is constantly aware of the books current location. It is irritating enough to prevent sleep. However, the effect cannot be felt whilst it is in direct contact with the user.
71	Shield	A creature you touch is protected from mundane attacks for one minute.	The book is bound in rusty ring-mail and is quite heavy. When damage is prevented by this spell, the initial caster of the spell involuntarily screams as if they were in pain.
72	Shroud	A creature you touch is invisible until they move.	The book is invisible until opened. The pages are thin and translucent like the wings of an insect, and the ink is a vibrant gold.
73	Shuffle	Two creatures you can see instantly switch places.	When not observed, this book will swap positions with any similarly sized object. This only happens once until found again.
74	Sleep	A creature you can see falls into a light sleep.	An owl with four unblinking eyes is stamped into the leather cover. The next time the caster of this spell attempts to sleep, they will fall into a waking trance and wander around until morning, unless interrupted.
75	Slick	Every surface in a 30ft radius becomes extremely slippery.	The book is extremely difficult to hold onto, and slips out of the user’s grasp with ease, despite feeling coarse and dry to the touch.
76	Smoke Form	Your body becomes a living smoke that you can control.	The text within is burned onto each page, glowing like hot embers when read. After use, the caster becomes deathly afraid of water for a few hours.
77	Sniff	You can smell even the faintest traces of scents.	Food in the vicinity of this book loses its flavor, becoming dull and unappetizing, despite smelling fine.
78	Snuff	The source of any mundane light you can see is instantly snuffed out.	The owner of the book will gradually become more uncomfortable in any light, even feeling painful itches when exposed to the sun.
79	Sort	Inanimate items sort themselves according to categories you set.	Any adjacent books slowly have the words on each page sorted alphabetically, starting at the front. If dropped or thrown, this book will always land perfectly upright on its end.
80	Spectacle	A clearly false but impressive illusion of your choice appears, under your control. It may be up to the size of a palace and has full motion and sound.	At random, colorful strips of paper are launched from the book when opened, accompanied by a loud pop.
81	Spellsaw	A whirling blade flies from your chest, clearing any plant material in its way. It is otherwise harmless.	The cover of this book is solid bark, from which branches and leaves grow every day.
82	Spider Climb	You can climb surfaces like a spider.	The cover is a perfectly symmetrical web rendered in ageing copper. Opening this book releases random species of spiders from the pages within. When left out of sight, spiders and cobwebs begin to occupy the space it is in.
83	Summon Cube	Once per second you may summon or banish a 3-foot-wide cube of earth. New cubes must be affixed to the earth or to other cubes.	For a day after use, looking at round objects causes the user to become nauseous, the more spherical the object, the more dizzyingly sick they become.
84	Swarm	You become a swarm of crows, rats, or piranhas You can only be harmed by blast attacks.	The more this book is used, the caster will become increasingly stressed about the possibility of being alone, becoming panicked if without company for even a few seconds.
85	Telekinesis	You may mentally 1 move item under 60lbs.	Small items in the vicinity of this pale tome will be rarely pushed at random, often falling off surfaces. The more brittle, the better.
86	Telepathy	Two creatures can hear each other’s thoughts, no matter how far apart.	Each double-page spread of this book must be read in alternating sequence, with one page read forwards and the other backwards, swapping back and forth with each word read.
87	Teleport	An object or person you can see is transported from one place to another in a 50ft radius.	The cover is a light teal with a 9 pointed star printed upon it in purple. Any pages torn from this book reappear back in place within seconds. The book gets hotter each time this is done.
88	Target Lure	An object you touch becomes the target of any nearby spell.	The runes inscribed on the cover of this book often flash brightly, but never long enough to be used as a light-source.
89	Thicket	A thicket of trees and dense brush up to 50ft wide suddenly sprouts up.	The book is wrapped in living vines that need to be ripped away before use. They regrow each day.
90	Summon Idol	A carved stone statue the size of a mule rises from the ground.	The covers of this tome are solid granite, but it is no heavier than a regular book. The statue takes the shape of the image last drawn within its pages. The accuracy is dependent on the caster’s artistic skill.
91	Time Control	Time in a 50ft bubble slows down or increases by 10% for 30 seconds.	The hands of a primitive clock on the cover must be moved to match the current time of day, causing the words within to become visible. Repeated use of this book will cause one to become increasingly impatient in nature.
92	True Sight	You see through all nearby illusions.	A winking red eye is emblazoned on the cover.
93	Upwell	A spring of seawater appears.	This book is bound in fish scales and riddled with living barnacles. The user’s breath will smell strongly of fish after use.
94	Vision	You completely control what a creature sees.	This ring bound book is protected by silver covers, with closed eyes engraved all over, aside from one, wide open and set with a green gemstone. When looked at, the green eye causes one to question reality, beliving all things are an illusion.
95	Visual Illusion	A silent, immobile, room-sized illusion of your choice appears.	Each page of this book must be held by the reader at a different, precise distance, or the words are blurred and illegible.
96	Ward	A silver circle 50ft across appears on the ground. Choose one species that cannot cross it.	Holding this book grants one a sense of peace and abates fear. Bizarre angelic creatures are printed on the front that cause unease if looked at too long.
97	Web	Your wrists shoot thick webbing.	The pages within the thin, paper bound book have no words, but instead show a series of fanciful illustrations indicating a set of gestures one must follow to cast the spell.
98	Widget	A primitive version of a drawn tool or item appears before you and disappears after a short time.	After casting, one may occasionaly forget how to use an everyday item. This could be something as simple as a spoon, shoe or quill.
99	Wizard Mark	Your finger can shoot a stream of ulfire-colored paint. This paint is only visible to you and can be seen at any distance, even through solid objects.	After repeated use, the caster will begin to see random solid colours when closing their eyes. Sometimes these will remain once their eyes are open, obscuring sight, and they must blink agin to see normally.
100	X-Ray Vision	You can see through walls, dirt, clothing, etc.	For a day after use, translucent and clear materials will appear opaque. This includes things like glass or water, but not gases.
